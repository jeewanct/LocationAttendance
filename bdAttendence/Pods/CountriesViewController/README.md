  - iOS 9+
  - swift 3.0

Here's a highlight of the main features you can find in CountriesViewController:
* **Current Locale Translations** Countries name are displayed using current locale
* **Single or multiple**. You can use selection as single selection or multiple selection 

## You also may like

Do you like `CountriesViewController`? I'm also working on several other opensource libraries.

Take a look here:

* **[InAppNotify](https://github.com/lucabecchetti/InAppNotify)** - Manage in app notifications
* **[SwiftMultiSelect](https://github.com/lucabecchetti/SwiftMultiSelect)** - Generic multi selection tableview
* **[SwiftMulticastProtocol](https://github.com/lucabecchetti/SwiftMulticastProtocol)** - send message to multiple classes

## Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like InAppNotify in your projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

#### Podfile

To integrate CountriesViewController into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'TargetName' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'CountriesViewController'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## How to use

First of all import library in your project

```swift
import CountriesViewController
```

The basic code to show a simple notification is:

```swift
//If you are in a UIViewController

let countriesViewController = CountriesViewController()
countriesViewController.delegate = self
CountriesViewController.Show(countriesViewController: countriesViewController, to: self)
```

You have to implement the CountriesViewControllerDelegate also:

```swift
extension YourViewController : CountriesViewControllerDelegate{
  /// MARK: CountriesViewControllerDelegate
    
    func countriesViewController(_ countriesViewController: CountriesViewController, didSelectCountries countries: [Country]){
        
        countries.forEach { (co) in
            print(co.name);
        }
    }

    func countriesViewControllerDidCancel(_ countriesViewController: CountriesViewController) {
        
        print("user hass been tap cancel")
        
    }
    
    func countriesViewController(_ countriesViewController: CountriesViewController, didSelectCountry country: Country) {
        
        print(country.name+" selected")
        
    }
    
    func countriesViewController(_ countriesViewController: CountriesViewController, didUnselectCountry country: Country) {
        
        print(country.name+" unselected")
        
    }
}
```

### Customization

you can customize this parameters during inizialization:

```swift
/// Create a controller
let countriesViewController = CountriesViewController()
        
/// Show major country (this countries are displayed in top of tableview, before each others)
countriesViewController.majorCountryLocaleIdentifiers = ["GB", "US", "IT", "DE", "RU", "BR", "IN"]
        
/// Set initial selected countries
countriesViewController.selectedCountries = Countries.countriesFromCountryCodes(["AL"])
        
/// Allow or disallow multiple selection
countriesViewController.allowMultipleSelection = true
        
/// Set delegate
countriesViewController.delegate = self
        
/// Show
CountriesViewController.Show(countriesViewController: countriesViewController, to: self)
```
